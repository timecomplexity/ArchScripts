# ArchScripts
Some basic Arch Linux scripts I've been using. As I update them and write more, I will add them here.

These scripts are very simple, and for the most part are here for my reference.
But as I improve them and add more, I might as well share.

Hopefully they will be of some use.

## Use As Commands
You can add these to your /usr/local/bin folder to use them globally if you wish.
`sudo mv /path/to/script /usr/local/bin/NameOfScript`
