# ArchScripts
Some basic Arch Linux scripts I've been using. As I update them and write more, I will add them here.

These scripts are very simple, and for the most part are here for my reference.
But as I improve them and add more, I might as well share.

Hopefully they will be of some use.



### Use As Commands
You can add these to your /usr/local/bin folder to use them globally if you wish.

`sudo mv /path/to/script /usr/local/bin/NameOfScript`

You might have to change permissions on these to make them work properly. For example:

`sudo chmod 755 NetworkReset`

This will make it editable only with root permission and readable/executable by all users.
